**Classroom Topic:** Understanding Visual Language/The Design Process

*   Why does an art work look the way it does? How does it express what the artist was trying to say? How does it express its age/culture? How/what can we learn from these examples?
*   Introduction to a design process (FRFRDPARC, Individual thinking, Peer Review, Brainstorming)
*   Introduction to computer programs for use in the class (solid modeling, web-based peer review, waterjet cutter path planning)

**Homework to start:** Create initial team website. Start solid modeling self-tutorial and complete your design for your inlay (e.g., solid model of your name where the letters are parts and the waterjet-cut tile and wood frame are also parts, then put it all together as an assembly). Research strategies for tile designs-subject, form, content-using library, internet, museums, brainstorming techniques, etc. Complete readings for next week in preparation for classroom discussion/presentation.
